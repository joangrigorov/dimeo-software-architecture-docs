**************************
This section provides a list of the stakeholder roles considered in the design of the architecture described by this
documentation. For each, the section lists the concerns that the stakeholder has that can be addressed by the
information in this documentation.

Each stakeholder of a software system is concerned with different characteristics of the system that are affected by its
software architecture. For example, the Customer and Internal Operational User are concerned that the system is reliable
and available when needed; the Strategic Leadership is concerned about development timelines and budget; The Development
Team is interested in in strategies to achieve all of those goals, and so on.
