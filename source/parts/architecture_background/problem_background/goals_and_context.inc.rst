#################

The primary goal of the DiMeo Waste Management System is to enable and support the company's subscription and on-demand
waste export services, which are the core drivers of its revenue. All subsequent requirements, architectural
design decisions, and trade-offs are made in service of this objective: to enhance operational efficiency and customer
satisfaction in alignment with the company's business model.
